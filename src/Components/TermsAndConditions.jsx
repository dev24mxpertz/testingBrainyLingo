      <h2 className="hdSumry">What are cookies?</h2>

      <p>
        Cookies are small data files that are placed on your computer or mobile
        device when you visit a website. Cookies are widely used by website
        owners to make their websites work, or to work more efficiently, as well
        as to provide reporting information.
      </p>

      <p>
        Cookies set by the website owner (in this case, GENAIFORGE INNOVATIONS
        LIMITED) are called "first-party cookies." Cookies set by parties other
        than the website owner are called "third-party cookies." Third-party
        cookies enable third-party features or functionality to be provided on
        or through the website (e.g., advertising, interactive content, and
        analytics). The parties that set these third-party cookies can recognize
        your computer both when it visits the website in question and also when
        it visits certain other websites.

      <h2 className="hdSumry">Why do we use cookies?</h2>

      <p>
        We use first- and third-party cookies for several reasons. Some cookies
        are required for technical reasons in order for our Website to operate,
        and we refer to these as "essential" or "strictly necessary" cookies.
        Other cookies also enable us to track and target the interests of our
        users to enhance the experience on our Online Properties. Third parties
        serve cookies through our Website for advertising, analytics, and other
        purposes. This is described in more detail below.
      </p>
      <br />
      <hr className="text-slate-300 p-2" />
      <h2 className="hdSumry">How can I control cookies?</h2>

      <p>
        You have the right to decide whether to accept or reject cookies. You
        can exercise your cookie rights by setting your preferences in the
        Cookie Consent Manager. The Cookie Consent Manager allows you to select
        which categories of cookies you accept or reject. Essential cookies
        cannot be rejected as they are strictly necessary to provide you with
        services.
      </p>

      <p>
        The Cookie Consent Manager can be found in the notification banner and
        on our website. If you choose to reject cookies, you may still use our
        website, though your access to some functionality and areas of our
        website may be restricted. You may also set or amend your web browser
        controls to accept or refuse cookies.
      </p>

      <p>
        The specific types of first- and third-party cookies served through our
        Website and the purposes they perform are described in the table below
        (please note that the specific cookies served may vary depending on the
        specific Online Properties you visit):

      <p>
        These cookies are used to enhance the performance and functionality of
        our Website but are non-essential to their use. However, without these
        cookies, certain functionality (like videos) may become unavailable.

        What about other tracking technologies, like web beacons?
      </h2>

      <p>
        Cookies are not the only way to recognize or track visitors to a
        website. We may use other, similar technologies from time to time, like
        web beacons (sometimes called "tracking pixels" or "clear gifs"). These
        are tiny graphics files that contain a unique identifier that enables us
        to recognize when someone has visited our Website or opened an email
        including them. This allows us, for example, to monitor the traffic
        patterns of users from one page within a website to another, to deliver
        or communicate with cookies, to understand whether you have come to the
        website from an online advertisement displayed on a third-party website,
        to improve site performance, and to measure the success of email
        marketing campaigns. In many instances, these technologies are reliant
        on cookies to function properly, and so declining cookies will impair
        their functioning.

        Do you use Flash cookies or Local Shared Objects?
      </h2>

      <p>
        Websites may also use so-called "Flash Cookies" (also known as Local
        Shared Objects or "LSOs") to, among other things, collect and store
        information about your use of our services, fraud prevention, and for
        other site operations.

      <p>
        If you do not want Flash Cookies stored on your computer, you can adjust
